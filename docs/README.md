# Home Assistant Configuration

Here's my [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) configuration running [Hass.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/) on a [Raspberry Pi 2 B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) trying to handle every aspect of the house that my lazy IT soul doesn't want to do on a day-to-day basis.
